# sct - set color temperature
Setting the color temp of the screen really only requires about 40 lines of C (80 or so all inclusive). sct is a crude utility which does roughly that. I'd say exactly that, but some of the calculations aren't actually exact. In any case, it looks much, much, better than anything xrandr is capable of delivering. It takes temperature values in the range 1000 to 10000. 

## Compile

```sh
$ make
```

## Usage

```sh
# Campfire style
$ sct 4500
# Dust storm on Mars style:
sct 2000
#Coffee free all nighter style:
sct 8000 
```
